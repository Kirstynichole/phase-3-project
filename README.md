This is my phase 3 final project at the Flatiron School.

For this project I only used Python, and it is a terminal based choose-your-own adventure game.

The Main.py file contains my code as I wrote it initially, and the game is fully functional and
the storyline is complete.

The refactoredMain.py file is a work in progess. In the refactored version, instead of each event 
being defined within its own method, I defined an Event class, and each decision will be an 
instance of the Event class.

(The game's storyline was co-written by my sister, S/O Reagan.)
